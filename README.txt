Description:
Implemented a bitcoin miner using a distributed computing model. The bitcoins were generated with user-specified no. of leading zeroes using SHA-256 on randomly generated strings. The goal of this project was to use Elixir and the actor model to mine as many coins as possible and to build a solution that runs well on multi-core machines.

Project Implementation:
Local: ./project1 k -> where k is the no. of leading zeroes required in the bitcoin
Remote:./project1 [server_ip_addr] -> specify the server ip address to connect

Project Details:
1-> Size of Work Unit:
100,000 Strings per worker. We are giving a range of values and base64 of each value is
calculated to which UFID is prefixed to it. Finally, SHA256 hash is calculated from it.
Reason: We selected these values as we wanted to keep the actors busy for not too long or too
less and found this to be appropriate.
We are maintaining a bucket at the client side which will accumulate all the bitcoins mined.
Once the bucket is filled, all the values will be sent at once. By doing this, we will ensure that the
serverâ€™s receive thread is not getting overwhelmed by all the messages sent by actors on the
client side.

2-> Result of running the program:
