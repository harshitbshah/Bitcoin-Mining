# Bitcoin-Mining
Implemented a bitcoin miner using a distributed computing model. The bitcoins were generated with user-specified no. of leading zeroes using SHA-256 on randomly generated strings. The goal of this project was to use Elixir and the actor model to mine as many coins as possible and to build a solution that runs well on multi-core machines.
